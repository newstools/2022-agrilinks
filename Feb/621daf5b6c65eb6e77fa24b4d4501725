Feed the Future Partnering for Innovation is changing the landscape for supporting agriculture in emerging markets by empowering the private sector to raise incomes and reduce hunger. Partnering for Innovation, a USAID-funded program, builds partnerships with agribusinesses to help them sell new products and services to smallholder farmers, who represent a potential market of more than 500 million customers worldwide. Businesses are provided with the investment assistance, expert guidance and technical support they need to expand in emerging markets and create a growing and lasting customer base for their agricultural innovations.
