Over the past decade, there has been an important evolution in how the private sector perceives and engages with low-income,rural communities in emerging markets. This evolution — based on the recognition that smallholder farmers should be drivers of their own prosperity — has catalyzed a new generation of business models focused on generating both shareholder and smallholder value. No longer within the confines of corporate social responsibility programs, these models have helped move business from themargins to the mainstream. Yet, many of these approaches continue to be the exception rather than the rule. Why then are these models and private sector partnership development approaches important? How can these new models create shared value? What are the critical drivers of success or failure? What roles can donors play to reduce risk and improve sustainability? How can business models improve the performance of partnerships with the private sector? This guide was developed for USAID to answer these questions, and is organized as follows: Chapter 1: Why are partnerships with the private sector important? Beyond providing a summary of the business case for developing private sector partnerships in low-income agricultural settings, this chapter also offers an approach to partnership development. Chapter 2: Why is understanding business models and risk important? This chapter explains how de-risking and value acceleration can strengthen public-private partnerships. It also includes the shared value canvas — a visual business model analytical framework designed to capture the most relevant elements of an inclusive business model. Chapter 3: What can we learn from practice through business models? This chapter classifies, analyzes and presents the most relevant smallholder business models. It provides insights into 11 business models, including key contextual uncertainties, critical success factors and potential.
