In response to the refreshed U.S. government’s Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS), released in September 2021, the Feed the Future Interagency Working Group on Research in support of the Global Food Security Act (GFSA), co-led by USAID and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is developing an updated Global Food Security Research Strategy (GFSRS) that lays out key opportunities for using scientific inquiry to achieve priority outcomes. An initial dialogue was begun in October 2021, providing the community with the opportunity to share general observations about the refreshed GFSS. The draft outline below is being shared to provide the research community with a further opportunity for comment as the new strategy takes shape.
