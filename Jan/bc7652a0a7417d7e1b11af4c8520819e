What work does USAID do in agricultural finance? That is the question we hope start answering during this month on Agrilinks. We have multiple goals, including: We'll do this over a series of blog posts that can be grouped broadly around the following topics: There will also be a webinar on how donors approach impact-linked finance in the agriculture sector with representatives from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, KfW (Germany), and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.  With emerging models and approaches that have been running for a few years, we want to have an open discussion about where subsidy is needed and how to target it to optimize impact. In addition to the above topics, we encourage anyone who has something they would like to share to register on Agrilinks, which will give you the opportunity to publish related blog post during this month yourself. You can take a look here for previous agricultural finance resources shared on Agrilinks. I will leave you with one last thought from my colleague Lawrence Camp from Agrilinks sister site Marketlinks: “We (USAID’s private capital practitioners) don’t have the answers. We have some thoughts, but the goal of this series is to solicit the answers [and discussion!] from the community of practice – you, the readers.” Note that you must register and be logged in to Agrilinks to post comments. We look forward to hearing from you!
